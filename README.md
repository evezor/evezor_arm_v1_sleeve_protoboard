# evezor_arm_v1_sleeve_protoboard

This board was intended to sit at the elbow of the robotic arm and serve as a prototyping area to create new ciruits. It has a 10 pin IDE port to connect gpio to the sleeve controller board, but this avenue was abandoned as there were many issues keeping things simple.
